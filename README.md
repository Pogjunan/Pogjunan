### About me
**I** am majoring in statistics. My hometown is Hayang-eup ( in Gyeongsan that it is near Daegu #15 minutes by car, and I'll arrive in Daegu) and I live in Jeonju.  <br>

**My GitHub** is created for Koreans, with the specific goal of establishing a blog and GitHub repository that Koreans can frequently use to study on their own. Building accessible resources for the Korean community is my objective. 
<br>
**I** started learning `Python` in March 2023, and it's been 9 months since I learn into machine learning and deep learning. I plan to gain a lot more experience in the future, and I hope my GitHub will be a valuable resource. Looking forward to accumulating more knowledge and skills.
